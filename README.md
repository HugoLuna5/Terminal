#Terminal Emulator for Android

*Note:* Terminal Emulator for Android development is complete. I am not
accepting pull requests any more.

Terminal Emulator for Android is a terminal emulator for communicating with the
built-in Android shell. It emulates a reasonably large subset of Digital
Equipment Corporation VT-100 terminal codes, so that programs like "vi", "Emacs"
and "NetHack" will display properly.

This application was previously named "Android Terminal Emulator". Same great
application, just with a new name. (The change was made at the request of the
Android trademark owner.)

This code is based on the "Term" application which is included in the Android
Open Source Project. (Which I also wrote. :-) )
